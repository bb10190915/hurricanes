### Notes on getting started with Git:
You'll want to install git and make a github account (if you want to modify the repository directly)
Install git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once git is installed, you can clone the repo with
`git clone https://github.com/gmellison/hurricanes`

(If you don't want type your password every time follow the ssh instructions here: 
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
The only commands you really need are: 

to update from remote:
`git pull`

to add a file, and send to remote:
`git add (filename)`
`git commit -m "commit message describing changes"` 
`git push`
